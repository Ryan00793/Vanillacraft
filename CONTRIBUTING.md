## Contribution Guidelines

* Please do not submit your IDE's project configuration files (eg. /idea folder however we're leaving .imls for now so that dependencies are correctly applied)
* In the future all contributions must be done through branches and be reviewed as write access to master will be taken away once we have a working plugin set.
* The current todo list can be found [here](Todo-list.md).

## Dependencies

So far the only dependencies you need are 
- [Bukkit and Craftbukkit](http://www.spigotmc.org/).
